## About this project
The purpose of this project is to compare different input and output data sets for hydroponic plant growing in order to compare these to get the best possible resuluts. 
The data will be represented in a .csv file. 
The input data consits of values such as the nutrient solution amount, hours of sunlight etc.
The output data can be (depending on the type of plant) the resulting height of the plant, mass of the plant, mass of the fruit (if any).

x and y values on a graph, y is the resulut dat, x is input data. see when derivative function equals zero (extreme point). 

## Usage
