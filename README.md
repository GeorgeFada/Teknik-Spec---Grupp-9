## About this project
The purpose of this project is to be able to take in data sets from hydroponic plant growing and analyse that data in order to make more informed to disicions leading to better plant growth. The app will take in data written in a spreadsheet and display it as a graph. The in-data as the x-axis, and the out-data as the y-axis. The app will also find the max-points on the graph to find what is the optimal in-data ex. sunlight hours/day for the maximum plant growth. These data points can be whatever you recorded, for example in-data could be sunlight hours or water provided, out-data could be the plant height or weight.

## Usage
In order to use this project, first must the recorded data be filled in to a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet can be downloaded as a .csv file, that file must be named "data.csv" placed into the same folder as "data_analys.py". You may need to replace a already existing "data.csv" file. Finally to run the app, run the "data_analys.py" file. Currently different functionality of the app is relegated to different branches. The graph functionality is relegated to the "med_graf_implementering" branch, and the complete GUI is relegated to the "tinker-gui" branch.
